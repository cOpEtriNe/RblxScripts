i've not been on github for a while, i didnt remember making this repo.
Now i recently deleted alot of files on my pc, including a script that i was going to upload to here.
The script was a bot that would tell random facts from a script including multiple facts.
Source: https://bestlifeonline.com/useless-facts/
One Day i will remake this script and probably make it better and release it on this repository or make a new one just for that specific script.
i will leave a video i recorded on youtube of the bot.

update:
some scripts are on my pastebin
https://pastebin.com/u/cOpEtriNeYT1



UPDATE 2:
I've found the original script for the factbot on my pastebin the script is public but i will make it private and upload it on here.
im gonna fix the script up because its buggy.


UPDATE 3:
The script has been published onto a new repository 
https://github.com/cOpEtriNe/RBLXFactBot
it has alot of new features compared to the old script, which only had around 1-2 updates.
And will continue to get updates
