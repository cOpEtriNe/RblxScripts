i've not been on github for a while, i didnt remember making this repo.
Now i recently deleted alot of files on my pc, including a script that i was going to upload to here.
The script was a bot that would tell random facts from a script including multiple facts.
Source: https://bestlifeonline.com/useless-facts/
One Day i will remake this script and probably make it better and release it on this repository or make a new one just for that specific script.
i will leave a video i recorded on youtube of the bot.
